# Vague approximation of a TODO list.

- [ ] Track "life" of a Pixel.  I want the cell colour to fade once a cell dies, rather than straight "off"
- [ ] Look to parallelising picture output.  It swiftly becomes the main bottleneck in the program
- [ ] Switch to producing video direct(?) instead of a series of PNG files in a directory, then consumed by FFMPEG
